You and your friend are playing a game with hoops. There are 
N hoops (where 
N is odd) in a row. You jump into hoop 1, and your friend jumps into hoop 
N. Then you jump into hoop 
2, and after that, your friend jumps into hoop Nâˆ’1, and so on.

The process ends when someone cannot make the next jump because the hoop is occupied by the other person. Find the last hoop that will be jumped into.

Input
The first line contains an integer 
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, a single integer
N.

Solution:

/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=s.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
		    int n=s.nextInt();
		    if(n==1){
		        System.out.println(1);
		    }
		    else if(n%2==0){
		        System.out.println((n/2)+1);
		        
		    }
		    else 
		    System.out.println((n+1)/2);
		}
	}
}
