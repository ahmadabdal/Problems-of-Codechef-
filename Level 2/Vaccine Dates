Chef has taken his first dose of vaccine 
D days ago. He may take the second dose no less than 
L days and no more than 
R days since his first dose.

Determine if Chef is too early, too late, or in the correct range for taking his second dose.

Input Format
First line will contain 
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers 
D,L,R.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one string - "Too Early" (without quotes) if it's too early to take the vaccine,
"Too Late" (without quotes) if it's too late to take the vaccine, "Take second dose now" (without quotes) if it's the correct time to take the vaccine.

Solution: 

/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner s= new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=s.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
		    int d= s.nextInt();
		    int l=s.nextInt();
		    int r=s.nextInt();
		    if(d>=l && d<=r){
		        System.out.println("Take second dose now");
		    }
		    else if(d>l && d>r){
		        System.out.println("Too Late");
		    }
		    else if(d<l && d<r){
		        System.out.println("Too Early");
		    }
		    
		}
	}
}
